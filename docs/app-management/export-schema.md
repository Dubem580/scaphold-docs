# Export Schema

Exporting your schema can be useful if you want to see what the raw JSON version of your data model looks like.

Scaphold manages two versions of your schema:

1. **Standard GraphQL**: Download a standard version of your GraphQL schema that you can use with any GraphQL server.

2. **Scaphold Schema**: Save a copy of your up-to-date GraphQL schema that you can use to create an app on Scaphold.
