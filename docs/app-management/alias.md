# Aliases

Simplify your API URL with an alias!

Now when you create an app, you can choose to set an alias. An alias is a unique name for your application that can be used in the URL to access your API.
For example, if I set an alias for my app of `scaphold` then I could access my application at the url `https://us-west-2.api.scaphold.io/graphql/scaphold`.

<aside class="notice">
  Alias names must be 6 characters or greater in length, must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes, and must not end or begin in a dash.
</aside>

You can also change an alias at any time by clicking `My API` at the top of the page.
