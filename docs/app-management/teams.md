# Teams

App development is always more fun and faster in teams! Which is why we've provided you the ability to collaborate with others on apps.

There are two ways to add a teammate:

1. **Bottom left of the left side panel** in the app-view.

2. **Settings Page > Team**

In addition to adding a teammate, you may also want to remove a teammate. To do so, navigate to the **Settings Page > Team**, click on the bubble under **Teammates**
that designates the user you wish to remove from this app, and a dropdown will appear that will allow you to remove that user.

  Transferring ownership of an app is also possible. Keep in mind that this will also transfer the payment method associated with a particular app, since payment methods
  belong to an individual user account (i.e. The app owner's payment source will always be the one associated with an app's billing).
