# Regions

Scaphold is now deployed in multiple regions and counting! With growing demand for Scaphold's service by developers around the world, we're always open to setting up new infrastructure
so that your data lives closer to you.

Currently, we're deployed in...

1. US West (Oregon)

2. EU West (Ireland)

3. More to come. If you wish to have Scaphold deployed on a data center in your region, please contact us at [support@scaphold.io](mailto:support@scaphold.io).

To switch between regions, select the region you wish to use in the **header bar of the Scaphold dashboard**.

  <b>Tip</b>: Your app's GraphQL API will be prefixed with the region that it belongs to (e.g. <code>https://us-west-2.api.scaphold.io/graphql/scaphold-graphql</code> is in the US West region).
